# grm-sx2

R Code to compute the $SX^2$-fit index for a graded response model that has been fitted with the lavaan-package. As of yet the code works only for items that with response categories. Also, the function all_expected_cell_frequencies() takes veeery long (depending on the size of the data this may be minutes) to compute the results.
